# vip_adpq
Our prototype is located at: https://vip-adpq.herokuapp.com/#/

Admin Credentials: admin/admin
User Credentials: user/user
Author Credentials: author/author
Reviewer Credentials: reviewer/reviewer

The prototype also allows new user account creation via the admin account or via self-registration.  Self-Registration will auto-assign the role of a "User".

The easiest way to create a new user is to use the Administration UI.  Log in using the admin credentials listed above.  
Once logged in, navigate to Administration -> User Management.  Click on "Create New User" and complete the required fields.
** _ By default, when an admin creates an account the password is the same as the user name. _ **

## Architectural Approach
In order to accelerate development on the prototype, the VIP team quickly organized around a proven, Java based, open source technology stack.  Our framework
of choice, JHipster is an industry leading development accelerator which packages and integrates several modern frameworks together including:
> Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security as core

> AngularJS for UI

> Node.JS for glue code

> Liquibase for DB scripting including DDL and DML Scripts

> maven for packaging and dependency management

> heroku for deployment

> TravisCI for Continuous Integration

> Docker for containerized database deployment

Additionally, we used:
> Github for code versioning and management

> Swagger to document our API

> MySQL as the open source database

> H2 as the in-memory database
## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Once Node and Yarn are installed, do the following


`yarn global add yo`

`yarn global add generator-jhipster`

`jhipster`

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

[Yarn][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.



## Building for production

To optimize the vip_adpq application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch the application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
